                            At 38 years old, Chiara Bautista is one of the most fascinating artist that has ever 
                            been revealed by the Internet. What fascinates is of course her work first, from 
                            sketches to digital art and painting, with recognizable gracious lines and elements 
                            that connect her to pop surrealism and graphic novels.

                        <p>
                            Indeed every piece of Chiara’s work is inhabited by mysterious and poetic creatures 
                            borrowed from fairy tales and released into the modern world. But it’s her story that 
                            makes Chiara’s work unique and spell-binding. Not especially her life’s bio, a bachelor’s 
                            degree in Graphic design and a long career as an illustrator for the Arizona Daily Star, 
                            in her home of Tucson, USA.

                            No, it’s her out-of-this-world, romantic relationship with her muse, nicknamed Ilka, met 
                            online and never in real life (as far as we know). The art of Chiara is a real conversation 
                            with her muse that we are able to witness, without having the keys of understanding, we are 
                            still caught up in all its magic and romance. No need to add more. The artwork and Chiara’s 
                            answers will give you a special insight into this enigmatic and fascinating artist.

                            The characters and their ongoing stories are made as gifts for people I love. 
                            They are usually born from conversations, most of them from a single sentence 
                            said at the right time.

                            I find very flattering that people like my work that much and I think it’s really 
                            sweet that they find a personal connection to the characters and their stories. 
                            As for myself, my only connection to tattoo art are the pictures people share 
                            with me when they get my illustrations tattooed on them, and the huge respect I 
                            have for tattoo artists.

                               There are some references to religion and martyrs in your art: is it an 
                               inspiration, and what meaning do you see behind it?
                            </b>
                            <br>
                            I’m Mexican, born and raised in México, and religion is a big part of my culture. 
                            Religious icons are found and seen everywhere, not only in churches, so I 
                            grew up with that imagery as part of the background. The meaning I see in it, varies, 
                            and the only thing that never changes is that I’ve always thought they are very 
                            beautiful.

                            music to work, but working is definitely a lot more enjoyable with music.

                            I have a lot of projects and never enough time to work on all of them. On top of my 
                            list, comics and graphic novels are something I’d like to try but I’d have to learn 
                            and practice a lot first. Telling a story frame by frame requires a lot more than 
                            just being able to draw. My admiration goes to all comic artists out there.
